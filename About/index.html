				<h2>I'm Andy</h2>
				<p>I'm a Illustrator and Digital Designer, with more than four years of commercial experience as a designer at Create.net. I ensure that my natural creative eye is present in all the work that I do, within both my career and personal projects. My goal is to take on greater challenges and develop my skills within a progressive and creative workplace.</p>

				<p>
					This project at heat was just a reskin with some small ui improvements, to improve this was to have a stronger sense of consistent design over the application. Having this consistent design in the app would strengthen the user flow / journey and to have a reusable pattern which would be future proof.

				<h2>Contact Me</h2>
				<p>I began this project by analysing the application which started the user journey, for example if I wanted to add a product to my shop or and a new page to my website, how did this look and how were the tasks different. I wanted these task for the user to be nearly visually identical so that once the user has done one of them they have done them all. By achieving this the learning curve would be easier to pick up over the application. </p>

					Picking out key elements from the application made it easier to see the inconsistencies, some of these were:
