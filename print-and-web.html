				<p>
					This is a collection of mixed print and web projects, these are some of the main projects I've worked on for Create's marketing material. A lot of this material was needed after Create's rebrand, this new marketing material needed to reflect the new Create brand identity throughout.

				<p>
					Further Create promotion was also featured in Craftseller magazine throughout the year.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ad space was half a page and needed to display Create's playful style. It was aimed at the craft audience and so was visually inline with this industry.

						The above banners were create to promote Create and its new product. They were used at Create events, exhibitions as well as meet and greets.

					<p>
						I created the design to be bold, direct and clear. I also took into consideration the brand consistency and any other print material.

					<p>
						In order to build company awareness and following the redesign, I created staff t-shirts. The design was minimal using a handmade process, nodding to the Create customer. I went to the local print studio to get them silk screen printed, the outcome was a crisp and clean.

					I created these graphics for online advertisement and Create's affiliate program. They were used in Facebook A/B tests, the Craftseller newsletter email and on user affiliate sites.
				</p>	
				<p>
					The designs were to be playful, eye-catching and colourful. Some of the graphics had motion in order to grab the user attention.

				<p>
					The two main tasks were to update the previous non-responsive email, to responsive, and to evolve along with the rest of the brand's design.
				</p>	
				<p>
					The design on right was the end result. The new design included a clear call to action, a photo of the customer account manager for a more human element (not the nice kitten) and give a sense of a warm welcome through colour and imagery.
