					<p>
						To go along with the new brand Create needed T-shirts, this design had very few design elements but I wanted to keep this design minimal and use a handmade process. I went to the local print studio to get them silk screen printed, the outcome was a crisp and clean design.

					These graphics were to be used for online advertisement and Creates affiliate program. They were used in Facebook A/B tests, Craftseller newsletter email and the user sites.

				<p>
					The two main tasks was update the previous email template to be responsive and visual closer to the new brand direction.

					The design to the right was the final design of many iterations then new email wanted to have a clear call to action, a human element which was the photo of the customer account manager (not the nice kitten) and have a warm welcome with the use of colour and imagery.
