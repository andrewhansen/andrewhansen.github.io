				<h2 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border">Project Overview</h2>
				<p>Create is a ecommerce based web platform, allowing the user to sell, build content and design their own website. The company has be going for more than 14 years and from this the application was showing a dated look and an inconsistent design pattern flow.</p>

				<p>
					This project at heat was just a reskin with some small ui improvements, to improve this was to have a stronger sense of consistent design over the application. Having this consistent design in the app would strengthen the user flow / journey and to have a reusable pattern which would be future proof.

				<h2 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border">The Process</h2>
				<p>I began this project by analysing the application which started the user journey, for example if I wanted to add a product to my shop or and a new page to my website, how did this look and how were the tasks different. I wanted these task for the user to be nearly visually identical so that once the user has done one of them they have done them all. By achieving this the learning curve would be easier to pick up over the application. </p>

				<p>
					Picking out key elements from the application made it easier to see the inconsistencies, some of these were:

				<h3 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border">Grey Design</h3>
				<p>Before starting designing these elements I needed to design the application from the ground up. This started with a grey design stage of the application from this early design  it would be easy to focus on the composition, material light and dark design.

					<p>Below are some of the draft wireframes which were picked from my section of drawings and moved into sketch.  </p>
