				<h2 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border">Project Overview</h2>
				<p>
					One of the most important products for the Create user are the website themes. For this project I was resposible for reviewing the company's current themes and looking at how they could be evolved.
					The main goals of this project were:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Move away from ‘one design fits all’.</li>
					<li>A design process to create future themes.</li>
					<li>Themes that are based on user segments and industry.</li>
					<li>Manage other design team members to assist with the process.</li>
				</ul>

					<h2 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border border-top pad-t-50">The Process</h2>
					<p>
						In order to fully understand how our current users were customising the themes and what was offered to them I printed out all of Create's current templates. I used these to create and sort a collection of designs. I segmented them by user type and industry, looking for any commonly occuring patterns.
					</p>

					<p>
						I assessed different template structures, colour palettes, use of imagery and any connection by industry. I researched the key design elements that can be associated to an indsutry and compared this with how our users were customising the themes to make them their own. The research was presented to the entire company to futher our knowledge of the Create customer base.
					</p>
					<p>
						
					</p>
					<p>
						The process below is how we planned, designed and built the themes. Each stage of the process was reviewed to ensure the new themes were going in the right direction and meeting the set deadline.

				<h3 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border">Stage 1</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Select industry and category for theme. E.g: "Food &amp; Drink" > "Cake Decorating"</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Create a “template-theme” folder. This was the library for all the fonts, colours, graphics, imagery and notes.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Carry our user research based on the chosen industry.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Gather and create graphics and imagery for the theme. These were used to create mood boards which and show off the first stage of design in an effective visual way.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Pick name to publicly describe the theme. This was used for the website url name.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Design theme logo.</p>

							Add a logo font, which was the same font as the designed logo, and have a fallback font.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Heading font, content font and icon font.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Create a colour palette, to show how colour logic would work on background and foreground of the theme.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Create wallpaper or graphics available for the user upon release.</p>

Below are a few themes I've picked out which use this process and show the outcome.

					<b>Industry</b> - Craft

					<b>Industry Focus</b> - Knitting &amp; Craft Material
				</p>
				<p>
					The visual starting point for Woolen was based around the products, picking out key visual elements to be used in the design. By doing this was able to designed a theme that had light, earthy, warm tones and was soft and playful.

				<p>
					<b>Industry</b> - Home &amp; Garden

				<p>
					<b>Industry Focus</b> - Gardening
				</p>
				<p>
					Eden's main focus was inspired by old gardening books. The theme needed to feel light, delicate and have mute tones. The colours picked for this came from the plants and pots, which had natural greens and earthy warm orange of the clay pots. I created the logo to feel light and clean but also weathered. Selecting a worn Slab Serif font reflected this well.

					This theme has a very minimal colour palette. Sweeney is a theme that is strong, minimal and luxurious.  Using a smaller amount of colours and tones lead to a clean design, using small details such as fine gold lines to do this.
