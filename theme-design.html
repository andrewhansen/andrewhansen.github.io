				<h2 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border">Project Overview</h2>
				<p>
					I was given this project to look at are current template themes how these could be improved, as this was a key feature of creates product. The main goals of this project were:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Move away from ‘one design fits all’.</li>
					<li>A process to create focused design themes.</li>
					<li>Manage other design team members to work to this process.</li>
				</ul>

					<h2 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border border-top pad-t-50">The Process</h2>
					<p>
						I began looking at creates current themes at that time, to see what we really offered our users. I printed out all of our templates so I had a whole collection of designs then started grouping them by industries, to see any common patterns were occurring.
					</p>

					<p>
						So I was looking at different template structures, colour pallets, use of imagery and seeing if there was a connection by industries. Also looking into key design elements that made an industry and what was the majority of users were trying to create. Doing this research really helped to give us a better understanding of creates users and the possible new user we could be attracting.
					</p>
					<p>
						
					</p>
					<p>
						The process below is how we plan, designed and build the themes. Each stage had a review at the end of it this was to ensure the new theme were going in the right direction and was on time.

				<h3 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border">Stage 1</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Pick industry and industry focus, for example  'industry - Food and Drink' and 'industry focus - Cake Decorating'</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Create a “template-theme” folder, this was to hold all the fonts, colours, graphics, imagery and notes in one place.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Research Create users based in the picked industry.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Gather / create graphics and imagery for the theme. This was useful for creating mood boards which was a great way to sho off the first stage in an effective visual way.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Pick theme name, this was used for the website url name.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

					<b>Industry</b> - Craft
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Industry Focus</b> - Knitting &amp; Craft Material
				</p>
				<p>
					The starting point for Woollen were the products of knitting, picking out key visual elements to be used in the design. By doing this we designed a theme that had light, earthy, warm tones and was also soft and playful.
