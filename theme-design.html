				<p>Create is a ecommerce based web platform, allowing the user to sell, build content and design their own website. The company has be going for more than 14 years and from this the application was showing a dated look and an inconsistent design pattern flow.</p>

				<h2 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border">The Process</h2>
				<p>I began this project by analysing the application which started the user journey, for example if I wanted to add a product to my shop or and a new page to my website, how did this look and how were the tasks different. I wanted these task for the user to be nearly visually identical so that once the user has done one of them they have done them all. By achieving this the learning curve would be easier to pick up over the application. </p>

				<p>
					Picking out key elements from the application made it easier to see the inconsistencies, some of these were:

					The starting point for Woollen were the products of knitting, picking out key visual elements to be used in the design. By doing this we designed a theme that had light, earthy, warm tones and was also soft and playful.
