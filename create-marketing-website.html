				<p>
					Create.net is an online website building platform, giving small and startup businesses the opportunity to build and manage their own ecommerce shop. Below are some of the projects that I have worked on. They include feature pages for new products, the implementation of the re-brand and customer success stories.

						I worked closely with the company directors to implement Create's new brand identity and the responsive aspect of the website. In order to achieve this I worked with Create's external designer to implement the marketing site designs and the responsive flows of the framework.</p> 
					<p>
						Due to the scale of this project I was responsible for the body of the code overhaul. I worked with other team members to delegate sections of the site to meet the deadline.

					<p>
						As part of the launch of Create's new product, Create Payments, I created a landing page to promote the feature and build awareness. The page was made up of six sections: 
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Small intro about Create Payments</li>
						<li>Key features </li>
						<li>Customer quotes</li>
						<li>Insight to Create Payments</li>
						<li>An incentive to join</li>
						<li>An action point</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Following this, tracking was added to see how users interacted with the page, allowing for future optimisations.

					<h2 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border pad-t-50">Success Stories</h2>
					<p>
						The brief for this page was to create an inspiring area for potential new customers. The aim was to increase the number of trials by showcasing current user websites. Here we were able to promote the product, to show the versatility of the platform and entice new customers to join.
