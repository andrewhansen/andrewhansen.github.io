						I worked closely with the directors to implement Creates new brand identity and implementing the responsive side of the website. This began working with anouther designer to implement their designs of the marketing site and work through the responsive flows of the framework.</p> 
					<p>
						This was a large project and I took the role of doing the main body of the code overhaul but also I worked with other team members and dedicated sections of the site to meet the deadline. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Other core pages of this update was the <a class="body-link" href="https://www.create.net/blog.phtml" target="_blank">Create blog</a>, <a class="body-link" href="https://www.create.net/features-pricing.phtml" target="_blank">Features &amp; Pricing</a> page and the <a class="body-link" href="https://www.create.net/support/" target="_blank">HelpCentre</a>.

					<p>
						After launch of Create Payments it needed a landing page, this was to promote the new feature and build awareness. To do this the page is made up from six sections, the following being: 
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Small intro about Create Payments</li>
						<li>Key features </li>
						<li>Customer quotes</li>
						<li>Insight to Create Payments</li>
						<li>An incentive to join</li>
						<li>An action point</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						From this we added tracking to see how users interacted with the page, to get the best use out of this landing page.
