				<p>
					Create is an ecommerce based web platform, allowing the user to sell, build content and design their own website. The company has been helping users for over 14, and as excpected was in need of an updated look and a more consistent pattern design, bringing it inline with the rest of the Create brand.

				<h3>Main Goal - Consistent Design</h3>
				<p>
					This project at heart was a reskin with some UI improvements. In order to improve this was to create a stronger sense of consistent design over the application. Having this consistent design in the app would strengthen the user flow / journey and lead to a reusable pattern which would be future proof.
				</p>
				<p>
					The screenshots below are the previous application design, including the Design Studio, Content and the Shop. These needed to be more visually connected with each other, have a clearer focus and be more inline with Create's brand.

			</div><!--
			--><div class="grid__item one-half palm--one-whole lap--one-half desk--one-half">
				<p>
					First of all I analysed the application starting with the user journey. If a user wanted to add a product to their shop or and a new page to their website, I would consider how these actions would appear and how the journey of each task would differ. It was important that these tasks for the user were as closely visually identical as possible, so that these tasks would be familiar to each other. 
				</p>
				<p>
					To gain a strong overview of the app I printed out each these pages to track and note the different visual tasks and layouts. This clearly showed where patterns were and were not. This also helped enable us to track these user journeys better.
				</p>

			</div><!--
			--><div class="grid__item two-thirds palm--one-whole lap--one-half desk--two-thirds">
				<p>
					Following this, drawing out key elements that form the application made it easier to see the inconsistencies. As these tasks used the same recurring elements they then required the same layout. This optimised the user experience for these tasks. One of the main elements that needed to be consistent was the data rows, as this was used across the whole application.

				<h3  class="heading-sml heading-sml--border">Grey Design</h3>
				<p>
					Creating the initial design without the use of colour gave me a blank canvas to work from, which helped me focus on the composition and layout of the elements. The first step was to work with light and dark tones which would hightlight and frame the focus sections of the application. A problem with the app's experience was the numerous distractions given to the user. By removing some of the icons and reducing the amount of colour used, improved where we wanted the focus to be on the screen.
				</p>
				<p>
					The images below are some of the sketch wireframes. The process was to draw up diffrent versions of wireframes to boil down and get the best result. The data row below was the most used pattern. I re-used this as much as I could so that the task of adding an image or arranging website pages felt familiar. Key elements which make that pattern work are 'headings and item names to the left' and 'call to actions and clickable elements to the right.'

				<h3 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border">Adding &amp; using Colour</h3>
				<p>
					Adding colour at a later stage meant that I was able to have more control over where colour was added and ensured that it had a purpose. I also expanded the colour palette with light and dark tones. These new tones gave a greater sense of depth and improved the readability of coloured elements, for example call to actions.
				</p>
			</div><!--

				<p>
					 A good example of how the use of colour in this design works well is with the use of blue and purple. Blue being hover state and purple being an active one. This small colour logic further enhances and facilitates the user's experience. Below are some example of this.
