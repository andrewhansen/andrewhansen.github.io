				<p>
					Create is a ecommerce based web platform, allowing the user to sell, build content and design their own website. The company has be going for more than 14 years and from this the application was showing a dated look and an inconsistent design pattern flow.

				<h3>Main Goal - Consistent Design</h3>
				<p>
					This project at heart was a reskin with some ui improvements, to improve this was to have a stronger sense of consistent design over the application. Having this consistent design in the app would strengthen the user flow / journey and to have a reusable pattern which would be future proof.
				</p>
				<p>
					The screenshots below are the previous application design, them being the design studio, content and the shop. These needed to be more visually connected with each other, have a clearer focus and more inline with creates brand.

			</div><!--
			--><div class="grid__item one-half palm--one-whole lap--one-half desk--one-half">
				<p>
					I began this project by analysing the application which started the user journey, for example if I wanted to add a product to my shop or and a new page to my website, how did this look and how were the tasks different. I wanted these task for the user to be nearly visually identical so that once the user has done one of these task it would be repeating the same pattern. 
				</p>
				<p>
					To get a strong overview of the app I printed out these screens to track and note the different visual tasks and layouts. This easily show where patterns were and were not, this was handy to track these user journeys.
				</p>

			</div><!--
			--><div class="grid__item two-thirds palm--one-whole lap--one-half desk--two-thirds">
				<p>
					After this picking out key elements that made up the application made it easier to see the inconsistencies. As these tasks used the same recurring elements they wanted to use the same layout, this would help with the user experience for these tasks. The main element needed to be consistent was the data rows as this was used all across the application.

				<h3  class="heading-sml heading-sml--border">Grey Design</h3>
				<p>
					Started designing without the use of colour simplified the application design, which made me focus on the composition and layout of the elements. The first step was to work with light and dark tones this would hightlight and frame the focus sections of the application. One of the problems of the app was that there were too many distractions, removing some of the icons and the use of lots colours improved the focus on the screen.
				</p>
				<p>
					The images below are some of the sketch wireframes, which were the process of drawing up multiple diffrent version of wireframes to boil down and get the best result. The data row below was the most use pattern, I wanted to reuse this as much as I could so the task of adding an image to adding and arranging your website pages felt fimlar. The key elements to make that pattern work was 'headings and item names to the left' and 'call to actions and clickable elements to the right.'

				<h3 class="heading-sml heading-sml--border">Adding &amp; using Colour</h3>
				<p>
					Adding colour at a latter stage focus around the idea that using colour as an aid for learning and with a purpose. I also expanding the colour palette with lighter and dark tones, these new tones were to give a great sence of depth and improve the readability of coloured elements. Adding colour slowing and only when needed, so added colour back into buttons first this was to improve the strength of the call to actions.
				</p>
			</div><!--

				<p>
					 A good example of how the use of colour in this design work well is the use of blue and purple. Blue being hover and purple being active, this small colour logic lession in the application really improves the experience. Below are some example of this.
